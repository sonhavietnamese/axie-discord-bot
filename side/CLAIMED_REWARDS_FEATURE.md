# 💰 Claimed Rewards Tracking Feature

## Overview
Enhanced the streak reward system to track claimed rewards, allowing users to claim rewards mid-game and continue playing with fresh streak calculations.

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. **Claimed Rewards Database**
- New `claimed_rewards` table tracks all reward claims
- Stores streak details, reward information, and timestamps
- Prevents duplicate claims of the same streak

### 2. **Reset After Claim**
- After claiming a reward, streak calculation resets from 0
- New streaks only count rounds after the last claim
- Users can continue playing and build new streaks

### 3. **Claim History Display**
- Shows recent claimed rewards in guess-history
- Displays reward type, candies, rounds, and claim time
- Clear visual indicators for claimed vs. available streaks

### 4. **Duplicate Prevention**
- Cannot claim the same streak multiple times
- Database checks prevent double-claiming
- Clear error messages for duplicate attempts

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Before Claiming:**
```
User has rounds 1-5 with 3+ consecutive correct guesses
→ Shows claimable streak button
→ Button: "Claim 12.50 Candies 🎁"
```

### **After Claiming:**
```
Previous streak: Rounds 1-4 (claimed)
New streak calculation starts from Round 5+
→ Only counts new rounds for future streaks
```

### **Continued Play:**
```
User continues playing rounds 6, 7, 8, 9...
→ If 3+ consecutive correct guesses: new claimable streak
→ Independent of previously claimed streaks
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### New Table: `claimed_rewards`
```sql
CREATE TABLE claimed_rewards (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  streak_rounds INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- Number of rounds in streak
  streak_candies INTEGER NOT NULL,     -- Total candies claimed
  start_round_id INTEGER NOT NULL,     -- First round of streak
  end_round_id INTEGER NOT NULL,       -- Last round of streak
  reward_type TEXT NOT NULL,           -- NFT, Premium Currency, VIP Access
  reward_details TEXT,                 -- JSON reward data
  claimed_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Updated Services
- **`RewardService`** - Handles claim tracking and history
- **`ApiService`** - Integrates with claim validation
- **`checkStreakRewardQualification()`** - Excludes claimed rounds

### Key Functions
```typescript
// Check if user qualifies (excludes claimed rounds)
await checkStreakRewardQualification(userId, userGuesses)

// Record a successful claim
await rewardService.claimReward(userId, streakRounds, candies, startRound, endRound, rewardType, details)

// Prevent duplicate claims
await rewardService.hasClaimedStreak(userId, startRound, endRound)

// Get claim history
await rewardService.getClaimHistory(userId, limit)
```

### Updated UI Components
- **Enhanced guess-history command** shows claim history
- **Button custom ID** includes streak range information
- **Clear messaging** about next streak starting point
- **Disabled buttons** after successful claims

## 📋 User Experience Flow

### 2. **Claim Process**
```

System: "✅ Congratulations! NFT added to collection!"

```

### 3. **Continued Play**
```

System: Shows claim history + new streak if qualified
```

### 4. **Claim History Display**
